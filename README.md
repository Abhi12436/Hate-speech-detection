# Hate-speech-detection

This project focuses on detecting and classifying hate speech in social media text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It preprocesses raw text data with tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization, then extracts features using TF-IDF and Word2Vec. Multiple models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and LSTM were trained and evaluated to identify offensive and hate content accurately.

Tech Stack:

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras

Techniques: Text Preprocessing, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, Classification Models

Results:

Achieved strong accuracy and F1-score in classifying hate speech vs. normal content. The LSTM model performed best for contextual understanding.
